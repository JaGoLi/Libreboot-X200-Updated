Workshops/hackerspaces
---------

You may have a GNU+Linux User Group, free software workshop or hackerspace near 
you that can help you with installing Libreboot, for instance.


Sellers on e-commerce platforms
---------------

On various e-commerce platforms (such as ebay) and in various countries, you 
can search for Libreboot and you may find some individual sellers providing 
Libreboot-preinstalled hardware.

Quality and dependability of these suppliers may differ from the experience 
from the shops on this web site.

Some of them also provide choice of GNU+Linux distribution, or they may provide
services where you can ship your Libreboot-compatible device to them and they
would install Libreboot for you.

This can be useful for some people, but due to the nature of these platforms, 
we cannot link listings since they are regularly deleted due to expiration 
(some sellers may choose to have longer listings, or renew expired listings).

Notable platforms that might offer Libreboot hardware are eBay, AliExpress, 
mercado livre (available for several South American countries).

**If you are considering purchasing from a supplier on eBay, make sure to read
their feedback comments for other products that they sell, and check their
seller rating. Don't get duped by a bad seller!**
