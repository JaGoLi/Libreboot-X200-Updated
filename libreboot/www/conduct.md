% Guidelines for Good Conduct

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers wish that participation in our project and our
community will be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

Our Standards
-------------

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to these conduct guidelines, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
-----

These conduct guidelines apply both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Specifically, in normal circumstances, the scope of these guidelines apply
directly to:

* The IRC channel and mailing lists
* The subreddit (r/libreboot on reddit.com)
* The notabug instance (at <https://notabug.org/libreboot>), which also
  includes bug reports and code review
* The contents of any contributions to Libreboot, including commits to the Git
  repository

Other communications channels are unofficial, and not part of the Libreboot
project.

Complaints
----------

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team
is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted
separately.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting one of the moderators privately via IRC private message
(see list below):

* Andrew Robbins: **and\_who** on Freenode, email
  [andrew@libreboot.org](mailto:andrew@libreboot.org)
* Leah Rowe: **unoccupied** on Freenode, email
  [leah@libreboot.org](mailto:leah@libreboot.org)
* Paul Kocialkowski: **paulk-X** Freenode (X is variable, for this
  person, email [paul@libreboot.org](mailto:paul@libreboot.org)
  check in the channel)
* Swift Geek: **swiftgeek** on Freenode, email
  [swiftgeek@libreboot.org](mailto:swiftgeek@libreboot.org)

If the complaint is for abuses on the Libreboot subreddit at
[r/libreboot](https://www.reddit.com/r/libreboot/) then there are a separate
group of moderators whom you can contact, via private message on the Reddit
website. The subreddit has a public list of moderators on it.

If you deviate from these guidelines, make sure that it is with good reason.
Treatment of each case will be handled pragmatically, on a case-by-case basis.

These are guidelines, and are not set in stone. We, as moderators, may choose
to enforce or not enforce these guidelines, in whole or in part, at our own
discretion. We are, after all, only human ourselves and we sometimes make
mistakes.
