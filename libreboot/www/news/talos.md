Recently, [Raptor Engineering](https://www.raptorcs.com/TALOSII/) has launched
a new series of workstation and server computers. These are high-end systems,
using the libre IBM POWER9 architecture, and the boot firmware is entirely
Free Software like Libreboot.

This is the *first* OEM producing *high-end* systems, from the factory assembly
line, with completely libre boot firmware. The boot firmware, operating system
and everything else is entirely Free Software. While not technically libreboot,
the boot firmware on TALOS II is Free Software, so it was decided that the
TALOS II would be promoted here on libreboot.org.

If you are in the market for a high-end, secure workstation or server with
100% free boot firmware (like Libreboot) and operating system, produced by
an OEM *hardware manufacturer* that cares about freedom, look no further than
the TALOS II from Raptor Engineering!

Their website for pre-orders is here:

An entry for the TALOS II has also been added to the
[suppliers page](../suppliers.md) on libreboot.org.

Raptor Engineering is the same company that ported the ASUS KFSN4-DRE,
KPGE-D16 and KCMA-D8 motherboards to Libreboot. In addition, they added support
for Hybrid Graphics on the ThinkPad T400 which Libreboot supports, enabling
those laptops to be used in freedom (with the AMD GPU disabled, in favour of
the Intel GPU which Libreboot has free video initialization for).

In response to the TALOS II launch I, Leah Rowe, have removed the Libreboot D16
(TALOS II's main competitor) from minifree.org, and removed the Minifree D16
entries from the [suppliers page](../suppliers.md) on libreboot.org.
I encourage Vikings and Technoethical, also present on that suppliers page, to
do the same and discontinue their D16 products. The TALOS II is very important
for the future of free, libre computing and indeed the free software community
as a whole; if TALOS II fails, we will be stuck for a very long time without
any viable high-end workstations that are libre. High-end hardware is necessary
for modern software development.
