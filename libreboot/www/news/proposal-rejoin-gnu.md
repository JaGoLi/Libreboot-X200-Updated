Community feedback is needed on whether Libreboot should re-join the GNU
project, having previously been a member. The discussion place for this topic
is on [this thread in the Libreboot subreddit at reddit.com/r/libreboot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/libreboot/comments/66tdds/proposal_for_libreboot_rejoin_gnu_community/). With sufficient community support, Libreboot will
apply to re-join to become a member of the GNU project. Full reasoning and
history behind this proposal is detailed in the thread.
