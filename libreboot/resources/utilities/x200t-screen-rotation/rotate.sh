#
# Usage: You can run this file with the command line option -s, -p or
# -t, or any combination, for example -sp, -ps, -tp, -tps. The
# behaviour is as follows.
#
# -s: Rotates the screen by 90 degrees. Depending on your desktop
# environment, the stylus input might get rotated or not.
#
# -p: Makes the stylus have the same rotation as the the screen.
#
# -t: Makes the trackpoint have the same rotation as the the screen.
#
# The script requires xrandr and xsetwacom.
