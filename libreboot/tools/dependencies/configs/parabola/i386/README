Each file in this directory contains a list of dependencies that
should be installed before compiling the program indicated by the
filename's suffix, with a few exceptions; these exceptions being
"deps-documentation", "deps-download", and "deps-generic" for reasons
noted below:

* "deps-documentation" contains a general list of packages that are
  needed to build Libreboot documentation.
* "deps-download" contains packages necessary for downloading either
  source code repositories and/or supporting files from a remote
  source.
* "deps-generic" contains generic dependencies that didn't quite fit
  (i.e. listed) under any of the other dependency lists but are
  necessary nonetheless.

It is expected that these files are updated whenever upstream projects
change dependency requirements.

Any duplications between files are intentional; in order to provide a
clear picture as to which dependencies are needed by individual
programs, any attempt to consolidate these lists is dissuaded.
