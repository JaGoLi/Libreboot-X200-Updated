# Our forums

The coreboot community has various venues to help each other and discuss the
direction of our project.

## Mailing list

The first address for coreboot related discussion is our mailing list.
You can subscribe on its
[information page](https://mail.coreboot.org/postorius/lists/coreboot.coreboot.org/) and
read its
[archives](https://mail.coreboot.org/hyperkitty/list/coreboot@coreboot.org/).

## IRC

We also have a
[real time chat](https://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23coreboot)
on the Freenode IRC network's #coreboot channel.

## Fortnightly coreboot leadership meeting

There's a leadership meeting held every 14 days (currently every other
Wednesday at 10am Pacific Time, usually 18:00 UTC with some deviation
possible due to daylight saving time related shifts). The meeting
is open to everyone and provides a forum to discuss general coreboot
topics, including community and technical matters that benefit from
an official decision.

We tried a whole lot of different tools, but so far the meetings worked
best with [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/syn-toap-agu),
using [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NRXqXcLBp5pFkHiJbrLdv3Spqh1Hu086HYkKrgKjeDQ/edit)
for the agenda and meeting minutes. Neither the video conference nor
the document require a Google account to participate, although editing
access to the document is limited to adding comments - any desired
agenda item added that way will be approved in time before the meeting.
