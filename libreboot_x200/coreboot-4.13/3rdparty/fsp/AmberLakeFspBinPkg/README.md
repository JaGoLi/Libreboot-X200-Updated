# AmberLakeFspBinPkg
This FSP binary is intended to be used with 10th, 8th and 7th Generation Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets formerly known as Comet Lake Y-Series, Amber Lake, Kaby Lake Refresh, and Kaby Lake. It is generally not intended to be used with 8th Generation Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets formerly known as Coffee Lake or Whiskey Lake.

In rare circumstances, this FSP binary is also used with 9th and 8th Generation Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets formerly known as Coffee Lake. Specifically, this FSP binary is only used with Coffee Lake desktop processors when installed in a motherboard that utilizes a 22nm Platform Controller Hub (PCH). This FSP binary is never used with mobile Coffee Lake or Whiskey Lake processors. The following Intel® 300 Series Chipsets use 22nm fabrication:

* Intel® Z370 Chipset
* Intel® B365 Chipset
* Intel® H310C Chipset

For all other Intel® 300 Series Chipsets, please use CoffeeLakeFspBinPkg.

Comet Lake Y-Series support has been added starting with FSP release 3.7.6, previous versions of AmberLakeFspBinPkg do not support Comet Lake Y-Series. For all other Comet Lake processors, please use CometLakeFspBinPkg.

AmberLakeFspBinPkg is the initial Intel® FSP to implement Intel® FSP External Architecture Specification v2.1. KabyLakeFspBinPkg supports similar Intel® Core™ processors and chipsets, however it implements Intel® FSP External Architecture Specification v2.0 instead of v2.1.
