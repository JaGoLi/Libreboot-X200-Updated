syntax: msrtool [-hvqrkl] [-c cpu] [-m system] [-t target ...]
	 [-i addr=hi[:]lo] | [-s file] | [-d [:]file] | addr...
  -h	 show this help text
  -v	 be verbose
  -q	 be quiet (overrides -v)
  -r	 include [Reserved] values
  -k	 list all known systems and targets
  -l	 list MSRs and bit fields for current target(s) (-kl for ALL targets!)
  -c	 access MSRs on the specified CPU, default=0
  -m	 force a system, e.g: -m linux
  -t	 force a target, can be used multiple times, e.g: -t geodelx -t cs5536
  -i	 immediate mode
	 decode hex addr=hi:lo for the target without reading hw value
	 e.g: -i 4c00000f=f2f100ff56960004
  -s	 stream mode
	 read one MSR address per line and append current hw value to the line
	 use the filename - for stdin/stdout
	 using -l -s ignores input and will output all MSRs with values
  -d	 diff mode
	 read one address and value per line and compare with current hw value,
	 printing differences to stdout. use the filename - to read from stdin
	 use :file or :- to reverse diff, normally hw values are considered new
  addr.. direct mode, read and decode values for the given MSR address(es)

No mode or address(es) specified!
