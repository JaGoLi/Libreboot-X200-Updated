Libreboot is a free BIOS or UEFI replacement (free as in freedom); libre boot 
firmware that initializes the hardware and starts a bootloader for your 
operating system. It's also an open source BIOS, but open source fails to 
promote freedom; please call libreboot free software.

Why use libreboot?

Many people use non-free boot firmware, even if they use GNU+Linux. Non-free 
BIOS/UEFI firmware often contains backdoors, can be slow and have severe bugs, 
where you are left helpless at the mercy of the developers; you have no freedom 
over your computing. By contrast, libreboot is building a world where 
everyone can use, study, adapt and share software, with true control and 
ownership over their technology. In other words, you should use Libreboot for 
your freedom's sake!

Libreboot is faster, more secure and more reliable than most non-free firmware, 
and can provide many advanced features (such as encrypted /boot/, GPG signature 
checking before booting your kernel, ability to load an OS from the flash chip, 
and more).

Libreboot's main upstream providers are coreboot (which we deblob, for hardware 
initialization), depthcharge (bootloader, and default libreboot payload on ARM), 
and GRUB (bootloader, and default libreboot payload on x86). We also 
integrate flashrom (for installing libreboot), and several of our own utilities, 
scripts and configuration files. All of this is integrated into a single, 
coherent package that is easy to use. We add our own patches to the various 
upstreams used, and where feasible try to merge upstream as much as possible.

Together, Libreboot's build system and documentation is provided with the aim
of making free boot firmware accessible to all.
