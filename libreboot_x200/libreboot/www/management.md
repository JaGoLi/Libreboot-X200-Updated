This document defines the nature of Libreboot's leadership structure.

Democratic governance of the Libreboot project
----------------------------------------------

In principle and in practise, Libreboot is a collectively and democratically
governed project. Any member of the public can propose anything. Our leadership
is a flat hierarchy; we have no leader!

Our core management team is open to the public; anyone can join it, if they
make substantial contributions to the project and if the current core
management team agrees. Libreboot is a *community* project.

All proposals, big or small, should be discussed and (if approved by core
management) implemented.

Information about code review can be found [on the Git section of the
website](git.md#general-code-review-guidelines).

List of members in the core management team
-------------------------------------------

In alphabetical order:

- Andrew Robbins is a core developer. IRC nick **and\_who**, email
  [andrew@libreboot.org](mailto:andrew@libreboot.org)
- Leah Rowe is a core developer (and project founder). IRC nick
  **unoccupied**, email [leah@libreboot.org](mailto:leah@libreboot.org)
- Swift Geek is a core developer. IRC nick **swiftgeek**, email
  [swiftgeek@libreboot.org](mailto:swiftgeek@libreboot.org)

Generally, the people on this list have these responsibilities:

- Code review (they have merge rights on the Git repositories)
- Voting rights on all major decisions, with community input.
- System administration (where necessary) for Libreboot's infrastructure.
- Moderation of the IRC channel, mailing lists and other discussion mediums.
- Comply with the [Guidelines for Good Conduct](conduct.md)

All members are granted SSH access, with varying levels of access depending on
need. At the very least, all members are able to update the website when new
changes to it are merged in the Git repository.

People of interest
------------------

These people are not part of core management, but still have influence.

Other IRC channel moderators:

- IRC nick **specing** on the Libreboot IRC channel.

specing occasionally provides assistance, and moderates the IRC channel.

Additionally, Libreboot has a separate set of operators on the subreddit
r/libreboot. Check Reddit for more information. Actions taken by moderators
there are also subject to these management guidelines.
