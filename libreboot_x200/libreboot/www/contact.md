IRC chatroom
============

IRC is the main way to contact the Libreboot project. `#libreboot` on Freenode
IRC.

Webchat:
<https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=libreboot>

Freenode is one of the oldest IRC networks, used for Free Software projects.
Find more about them here: <https://freenode.net/>

If you wish to connect using your preferred client (such as weechat or irssi),
the connection info is as follows:

* Server: `chat.freenode.net`
* Channel: `#libreboot`
* Port (TLS): `6697`
* Port (non-TLS): `6667`

We recommend that you use port `6697` with TLS encryption enabled.  

Here are some guides for various IRC clients:

Tor

You can use Tor, when connecting to Freenode. This may be beneficial, because
Freenode is censored in some countries. Read this article:
