The company re-opened on 10 November 2020, after closing in early 2020 due to
Covid19 pandemic. Some fundamental changes were made to the operation: laptop
options greatly simplified, with just 1 configuration per laptop, but a lot more
extras included by default. Laptops are now pre-packed and ready to ship before
being sold on the website, and so the service is extremely efficient (previously,
as with most Libreboot suppliers, laptops were assembled to order, after sale).

Workshops/hackerspaces
---------

You may have a GNU+Linux User Group, free software workshop or hackerspace near 
you that can help you with installing Libreboot, for instance.


Sellers on e-commerce platforms
---------------

On various e-commerce platforms (such as ebay) and in various countries, you 
can search for Libreboot and you may find some individual sellers providing 
Libreboot-preinstalled hardware.

Quality and dependability of these suppliers may differ from the experience 
from the shops on this web site.

Some of them also provide choice of GNU+Linux distribution, or they may provide
services where you can ship your Libreboot-compatible device to them and they
would install Libreboot for you.

This can be useful for some people, but due to the nature of these platforms, 
we cannot link listings since they are regularly deleted due to expiration 
(some sellers may choose to have longer listings, or renew expired listings).

Notable platforms that might offer Libreboot hardware are eBay, AliExpress, 
mercado livre (available for several South American countries).

**If you are considering purchasing from a supplier on eBay, make sure to read
their feedback comments for other products that they sell, and check their
seller rating. Don't get duped by a bad seller!**
