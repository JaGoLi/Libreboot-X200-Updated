Linux](https://blog.rosenzweig.io/blobless-linux-on-the-pi.md) on the Raspberry
Pi without blobs. **Former libreboot project maintainer.**

--------------

Works on large parts of Libreboot's build system and related documentation.
Andrew joined the Libreboot project as part of core management on 4 June 2017.
IRC nick `and_who` on #libreboot IRC. **Current libreboot project maintainer.**

Arthur Heymans
--------------

Merged a patch from coreboot into libreboot, enabling C3 and C4 power
states to work correctly on GM45 laptops. This was a long-standing issue
before Athur's contribution. Arthur also fixed VRAM size on i945 on
GM45 systems, allowing maximum VRAM allocation for the onboard GPUs on
these systems, another longstanding issue in libreboot. Contact **apvh**
in the \#libreboot IRC channel. **Former libreboot project maintainer**.

Damien Zammit
-------------

Maintains the Gigabyte GA-G41M-ES2L coreboot port, which is integrated
in libreboot. Also works on other hardware for the benefit of the
libreboot project. Contact **damo22** on the freenode IRC network. This
person's website is [zammit.org](http://www.zammit.org/). **Former libreboot
project maintainer.**

Denis Carikli
-------------

Based on the work done by Peter Stuge, Vladimir Serbineko and others in
the coreboot project, got native graphics initialization to work on the
ThinkPad X60, allowing it to be supported in libreboot. Denis gave
a lot of advice and helped found the libreboot project. Contact
**GNUtoo-irssi** in the \#libreboot IRC channel. Denis is also one of
the founders of the [Replicant](http://replicant.us/) project.

Jeroen Quint
------------

Contributed several fixes to the libreboot documentation, relating to
installing Parabola with full disk encryption on libreboot systems.

Made many fixes and improvements to the GRUB configuration used in
libreboot, and several tweaks to the build system. Contact **kl3** in

libreboot project maintainer.**

Paul Menzel
-----------

Investigated and fixed a bug in coreboot on the ThinkPad X60/T60 exposed
by Linux kernel 3.12 and up, which caused 3D acceleration to stop
working and video generally to become unstable. Paul worked with Libreboot on
this, sending patches to test periodically until the bug was fixed
in coreboot, and then helped her integrate the fix in libreboot. Contact
**PaulePanter** in the \#libreboot IRC channel.

Peter Stuge

Helped write the [FAQ section about DMA](../faq.md#hddssd-firmware), and provided
general advice in early days of the project. Contact **CareBear\\** in
the \#coreboot IRC channel on freenode.

Steve Shenton
-------------

Ported the ThinkPad X200 to libreboot, by figuring out how to deactive
the Intel Management Engine on that laptop, and remove the firmware
while still making the system boot correctly. The ThinkPad T400, T500,
R400 and R500 were also ported to libreboot, based on this work.
