% Libreboot workshop at Freenode #live 2018 Conference in Bristol, UK

% 2 November 2018

Freenode #live is the annual conference held by
[Freenode](https://freenode.net/) in Bristol, UK. This year I, Leah Rowe, will
be there doing a talk about Libreboot at 10AM (UTC +0) on November 3rd. In
addition, I have decided (hence this announcement) at the last minute that I'm
taking my SPI flashing equipment with me. More details about this conference
are on the Freenode #live website: <https://freenode.live/>

If anyone attending this conference wants their system flashed with Libreboot,
bring it to the conference. I'll be volunteering at the FSF booth there all
day on both Saturday and Sunday.

I will also be representing the FSF as a volunteer on both days.
