Today, we welcome Andrew Robbins (IRC nick `and_who` and

Andrew works on critical improvements to the build system, many of which have
already been merged. He is passionate about Libreboot, understanding the
project at a deep level, and he has been an active member of the community.
Thus, with unanimous agreement from the existing maintainers, Andrew has joined
the project officially.

We look forward to Andrew's next contributions as our project continues to
grow.
