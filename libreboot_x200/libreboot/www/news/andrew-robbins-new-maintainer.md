On 25 April, Libreboot adopted new [collective governance
policies](../management.md), creating a flat-hierarchy leadership of four
people. As a result, all patches are reviewed, and all major decisions are
voted on by the maintainers with community input. These policies formalise our
democratic standards.

Today, we welcome Andrew Robbins (IRC nick `and_who` and
[NotABug](https://notabug.org) user [and_who](https://notabug.org/and_who)) as
our first new maintainer under the new policy. Going forward, Andrew will gain
push access to Libreboot in order to review patches, as well as voting rights
and IRC operator status.

Andrew works on critical improvements to the build system, many of which have
already been merged. He is passionate about Libreboot, understanding the
project at a deep level, and he has been an active member of the community.
Thus, with unanimous agreement from the existing maintainers, Andrew has joined
the project officially.

We look forward to Andrew's next contributions as our project continues to
grow.

The new list of maintainers is as follows:

- Alyssa Rosenzweig
- Andrew Robbins
- Leah Rowe
- Paul Kocialkowski
- Swift Geek
