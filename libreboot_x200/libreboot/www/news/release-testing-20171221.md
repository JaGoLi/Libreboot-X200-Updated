We need testers, especially hardware testers, for a new upcoming release of
Libreboot.

Andrew Robbins, one of the developers, has done extensive work on the build
system in Libreboot and now we are rebasing all boards in Libreboot onto the
latest version of coreboot. Upstream coreboot has many bugfixes, which the
version that Libreboot uses (an older revision) does not have.

We are currently assembling a team of testers. If you wish to participate,
then reply on this thread in our bug tracker:

<https://notabug.org/libreboot/libreboot/issues/373>

Any help would be appreciated. In general, testing is also needed (e.g.
build testing, documentation testing/improvements, etc).
