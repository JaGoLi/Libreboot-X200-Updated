% New development mailing list for Libreboot

Our sysadmin, Alyssa Rosenzweig, has set up a mailing list on libreboot.org
infrastructure, for development discussions.

The mailing list address is
[development@libreboot.org](mailto:development@libreboot.org)

Information about the mailing list and how to subscribe are
on the [lists page](../lists/). Archives of discussion threads
are in the [pipermail development directory](../pipermail/development/).

This replaces the mailing lists that we had before. The mailing list software
in use is [GNU Mailman](https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/), which is also
used by many other free software projects and is very popular. If you already
use mailing lists in other projects, then the way to use Libreboot's new
mailing list is exactly the same.

This mailing list is for development discussion *only*. User support is still
handled via #libreboot on Freenode IRC, as always.

This new mailing list will also be used for beta testing of upcoming stable
releases, from now on. Work is currently underway on a new Libreboot release.
